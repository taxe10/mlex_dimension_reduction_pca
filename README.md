# mlex_dimension_reduction
Dimension reduction algorithms for the MLExchange platform.
  - [PCA](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html)
  - [UMAP](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Getting started
To get started, you will need:
  - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

## Running
First, build the dimension reduction image in terminal:
`cd mlex_dimension_reduction`
`make build_docker`

Once built, you can run the following examples:
`make PCA_example`

which is equivalend to first `make run_docker` then `python pca_run.py example_umap.yml`.

These examples utilize the information stored in the folder /data. The computed latent vectors will be saved in data/output.

## Developer Setup
If you are developing this library, there are a few things to note.

1. Install development dependencies:

```
pip install .
pip install ".[dev]"
```

2. Install pre-commit
This step will setup the pre-commit package. After this, commits will get run against flake8, black, isort.

```
pre-commit install
```

3. (Optional) If you want to check what pre-commit would do before commiting, you can run:

```
pre-commit run --all-files
```

4. To run test cases:

```
python -m pytest
```
